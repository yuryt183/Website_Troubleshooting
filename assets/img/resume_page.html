	<h1>A thermoelectric cloud chamber project</h1>
	<p>My name is Yury Tsimafeyeu, and I recently embarked on a project to build a thermoelectric cloud chamber. This device makes ionizing radiation visible to the naked eye in the form of fog trails.</p>

	<h2>The Wilson cloud chamber effect</h2>
	<p>To begin my project, I researched the methods for achieving the Wilson cloud chamber effect, which taught me the basic principles that made my project possible. The effect is achieved by supersaturated alcohol vapors coming into contact with ionizing radiation in a sealed container. Once proper conditions are reached, the charged particles which are emitted from a source of radiation ionize the fog in its way, creating a trail of ions. These ions act as condensation nuclei, resulting in the surrounding vapor particles condensing around them, forming a visible trail of fog in the process.</p>

	<h2>The challenges I faced</h2>
	<p>Despite the apparent simplicity of the process, achieving the necessary conditions proved to be a daunting task. The first and most critical step was to ensure that the alcohol vapor was saturated, which required the inside of the chamber to be below freezing temperature. To achieve this, I decided to use thermoelectric Peltier units, which effectively lowered the temperature inside the chamber and ensured optimal conditions for the formation of the cloud trails.</p>

	<p>However, using thermoelectric Peltier units came with its own set of challenges. The main issue was controlling the temperature precisely, which required significant experimentation and fine-tuning. I had to adjust the power and timing of the Peltier units to ensure that the temperature inside the chamber was consistently below freezing without dropping too low and risking damage to the equipment.</p>

	<p>Another challenge was sourcing the right materials and constructing the chamber itself. I had to carefully select and procure high-quality materials, such as a vacuum pump, glass jar, and metal base, to ensure the chamber was sturdy, airtight, and could withstand the extreme conditions required for the cloud chamber effect. Additionally, I had to construct the chamber with precision, taking care to seal all joints and openings to ensure there were no leaks.</p>

	<h2>The end result</h2>
	<p>Despite these challenges, the end result was well worth the effort. Witnessing the visible trails of ionizing radiation was a fascinating experience and a testament to the power of science and technology. The thermoelectric cloud chamber opened up a whole new world of possibilities for exploring and understanding the mysteries of ionizing radiation, making it an incredibly rewarding project.</p>

	<h2>The technical details</h2>
	<p>For those interested in the technical details, I settled on a design that utilized a 12V and 5V Peltier with the 5V one being on the top. I used a jar lid as the base of the chamber for better heat exchange, and applied thermal paste to ensure adequate heat transfer. I set this up on top of a heatsink, the bottom of which had to be frozen in a glass container in order for it to keep its temperature. In the end, my chamber worked, and I tested it with americium that I got out of a smoke detector, as well as uranium and trinitite that I bought at a geology show.</p>
